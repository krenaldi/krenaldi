My journey has been a dynamic one, starting from my tenure at AT&T, where I gained expertise in network troubleshooting and debugging code, along with project management and top-notch customer service skills.

🛠️ I firmly believe in going the extra mile, a philosophy that's been recognized by my customers who've nominated me for company accolades at AT&T. My mantra, "It's better to be pro-active than reactive," has guided me through large-scale projects, ensuring their success.

🌟 Technical Skills Snapshot:
- Expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and more.
- Proficiency in Redux, GraphQL, Linux, SQL, Node.js, and API development.
- Skilled in Azure, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and more.

🌱 My passion for learning and growth has driven me from Web Developer to Network Admin to Technical Account Manager to Full Stack Instructor and Full Stack Developer. Currently specializing in Cloud & DevOps technologies through the implementation of projects based on real scenarios with focus on technologies and services from AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud with the objective of supporting companies in their migration and modernization journeys from on-premises to Cloud.
